# Details Overview

As we stepped over the [create-extension tutorial](../tutorial/01-intro-create-extension.md) we glossed over many details.

Here's some more depth:

* [Hiconic Core Principles](core-principles.md) - basic principles that led to development of this architecture.

* [Extension Artifacts](extension-artifacts.md) - details on all the artifacts that make up an extension.

* [Service Processors](service-processors.md) - more in-depth look at `Service Processors` and `Service Domains`.

* [Tomcat Configuration](tomcat-config.md) - how `Tomcat` server is prepared locally and how comes `Eclipse` is able to start it with the correct project from workspace (`hc-example-setup-debug`) on board.
