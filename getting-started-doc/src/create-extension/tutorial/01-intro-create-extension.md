# Introduction

This tutorial covers:
* Creating a `Tribefire` extension with a sample `ServiceProcessor` with `Jinni` CLI tool
* Preparing `Eclipse` workspace
* Running the application from `Eclipse`
* Adding more requests to the sample `ServiceProcessor`

## Motivation

`Tribefire` offers a modular architecture with a core platform, which is primarily a base for adding extensions. Everything else comes as an extension, whether it's custom code or common features like:
* Storing data in SQL DB
* `REST` API
* Render data as HTML

## Preconditions

* [devrock-sdk](/intro/details/devrock-sdk.md) local environment with tooling
* [dev-env](/intro/details/dev-environment.md) understanding
* [Eclipse with Devrock and Tomcat plugins](/eclipse-setup/tutorial/00.intro.md)
