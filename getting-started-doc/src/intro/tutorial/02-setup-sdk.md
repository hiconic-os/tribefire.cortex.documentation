# Setup SDK - Tutorial Introduction

## Install the Devrock-SDK
  - Download the package from here: [Download SDK](https://academy.modularmind.eu/services/download-sdk) 
  - Unpack the `devrock-sdk` root folder from the zip file to a directory of your choice. We recommend this directory being close to a root to keep paths as short as possible.<br/>**Example:** `/dir-of-your-choice/devrock-sdk/`
  - Add `devrock-sdk/tools/jinni/bin` to your **PATH** environment variable
  - Important for Windows users: Add the `devrock-sdk` folder to the exception list in Windows Virus & threat protection settings. Otherwise, Windows will scan all downloaded files one-by-one, causing performance problems. 
  - verify installation by running `jinni version`. Expected output:
  
  ```plain
            °  ┌────┐
    ┌    ┌──┴───────┘
    └────┘        °
