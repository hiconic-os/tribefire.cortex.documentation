# Create Development Environment - Tutorial Introduction

In your command line move to the directory `env` in your `devrock-sdk` and execute the command:

```cli
jinni create-dev-env explorer-experience
```

The command creates a development environment given by a directory named `explorer-experience`. It will establish you with a `context` in which you could develop or setup a platform.
