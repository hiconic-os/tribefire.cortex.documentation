# Unpacking Eclipse

In case you already have an eclipse installation you can immediatly progress to the next step.

Unpack the downloaded zip file to a folder of your choice. 

It will create a folder 'eclipse' below your selected folder. 

You now create a shortcut or a link - whatever your operating system favours - to the eclipse executable. 

On a Windows machine, the executable would be 

```
unpack-folder/eclipse/eclipse.exe`
```

Start eclipse with its executable to be able to install the required plugins in the next steps. Eclipse will suggest a default workspace in your user's home. You can proceed with that suggestion as the workspace is irrelevant for the next steps.
