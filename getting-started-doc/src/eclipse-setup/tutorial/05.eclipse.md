# Unpacking

## Part I : installing Eclipse

Now unpack the zip file to a folder of your choice. 

It will create a folder 'eclipse' below your selected folder. 

You now create a shortcut or a link - whatever your operating system favours - to the eclipse runner file. 

On a Windows machine, the runner would be 

> <your selected folder>/eclipse/eclipse.exe

The basic Eclipse doesn't need any further configuration, and once you start it with a workspace from a dev-env, the setup will be - basically - configured as well.
